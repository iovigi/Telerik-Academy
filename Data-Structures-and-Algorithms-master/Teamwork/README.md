# Teamwork Rules

**More details comming soon...**

## Teams

Teams are formed by **2 or 3 of the students** by their own choice.

In this teamwork, if a team member doesn't participate in the teamwork he will not be punished.

If the team does not submit any solution, the whole team will have 0 points to their teamwork component in the final score (no special punishments here, too).

## Task

The task is to create an AI (artificial intelligence) player for one of the two games:

* [Santase (Сантасе)](https://github.com/NikolayIT/SantaseGameEngine/)
* [Texas Hold'em](https://github.com/NikolayIT/TexasHoldemGameEngine)

Mainly the teams should send their work in a [special web portal](https://github.com/NikolayIT/GameAITesterOnline):

## Working in private repositories

Each team should work in their own **private GitHub repository** with access granted to the trainers (@NikolayIT, @ivaylokenov, @Minkov, @evlogihr). After teamwork is over, the repository should be open-sourced.

Sadly, the private repositories in GitHub are paid, but the *GitHub Micro plan* costs only *7$ for 5 private repositories* for 1 month. Two teams working on **different games** can split the expenses and pay only 1 account for 1 month and use 2 of the private repositories. For example: if the first team consists of 3 and the second team consists of 2 students (total 5) they can split the expense and each student will pay only 1.4$ (about 2.50 leva)

## Evaluation

* 65% - Position versus other players
* 15% - Public defence of the algorithm
* 10% - High-quality code
* 5% - Detailed documentation of the algorithm
* 5% - GitHub contributions (if any) to the game engine repositories
